TECHNOLOGIES USED

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

APIs Used:
NewsNow API: Fetches real-time news articles based on topics and regions.

Deployment:
Nginx
For deployment, the scp command was used to transfer the project files from the local machine to the server. A new directory called GlobalNews was created under /var/www/, which was then referenced in the Nginx configuration file located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/GlobalNews. This directory is set as the root to serve the HTML files.

A symbolic link was then created in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ named GlobalNews using the ln -s command, ensuring that the server knows where to look for the website files.

HAProxy
In the load balancing configuration, two servers, web01 and web02, were set up to handle incoming requests. Routing was configured so that based on specific routes, the requests were forwarded to the appropriate server, ensuring efficient load distribution and seamless access to the application.
